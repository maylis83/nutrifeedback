    <p class='section-title-static'>Terms:</p>


    <p>  Revised: October 28th, 2014</p>

    <p>  These Terms of Service for Clients (“Terms”) govern your use of the For The Nutrifeedback Incorporated (“Nutrifeedback”) website and mobile application (collectively, the “Site”) and the Nutrifeedback services (“Services”). These Terms apply to all users of the Site and Services. By accessing or using the Site or Services, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <p> 1. Services</p>

    <p>The Site and Services offer you a marketplace platform where users who seek health coaches in any type of heath goals, or diet restriction (“clients”) can select someone with the specific skill-set and interest the client is looking for (“health coaches”) in their location or any other location and health coaches can offer those services and classes to clients. Clients can locate health coaches, schedule appointments, communicate with instructors, and pay health coaches using the Site and Services. Health coaches can post health coaching services and classes, schedule appointments, communicate with clients, and receive payment using the Site and Services.</p>

    <p> The Site and Services may only be used to obtain or offer health coaching services; no other services may be obtained or offered. Health coaches are not employees of Nutrifeedback and Nutrifeedback is not hiring a health coach for a client. As between Nutrifeedback and any health coach, health coaches are responsible for paying any taxes required by law. Nutrifeedback may, but is not obligated to, conduct reviews, verifications, and background checks of clients and health coaches. Nonetheless, Nutrifeedback does not have control over the quality, timing, or legality of the services actually delivered by health coaches, nor of the integrity, responsibility or actions of clients or health coaches and we make no warranties or guarantees about them.</p>

    <p> 2. Eligibility</p>

    <p> You must be at least 21 years old to use the Site or the Services.</p>

    <p> 3. Additional Terms</p>

    <p> Some of our Services have additional terms and conditions (“Additional Terms”). Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, we will make them available for you to read through prior to your use of that Service. By using such Services, you agree to the applicable Additional Terms.</p>

    <p> 4. Acceptable Use of the Site and Services</p>

    <p> violate any law or regulation;</p>
    <p>violate or infringe other people’s intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other legal rights;</p>
    <p> use our Site or Services to transmit, distribute, post, or submit any information concerning any other person or entity, including without limitation, photographs or personal contact information of others, without their permission;</p>

    <p> searchable indices of the materials, and Nutrifeedback reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases);</p>
    <p>use automated methods to use the Site or Services in a manner that sends more requests to the Nutrifeedback servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional web browser;</p>

    <p>access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Site, Nutrifeedback’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Nutrifeedback’s providers;</p>
   <p> attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Nutrifeedback system or network or breach any security or authentication measures;</p>

    <p>9. Third Party Content and Interactions</p>

   <p> The Site and Services may contain features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access to third party content which is completely independent of Nutrifeedback, including websites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet in general. Your interactions with organizations or individuals, including clients and instructors, found on or through the Site and Services are solely between you and such organizations or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any interaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Nutrifeedback is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind or nature incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between users of the Site or Services, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Nutrifeedback is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with any other user of the Site or Services, you hereby release Nutrifeedback and its affiliates, and their officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes or the Site and Services. </p>

   <p> 10. Payment</p>

    <p>Clients</p>

    <p>When a client schedules a class or session with an instructor through the Site, the client must provide the requested credit card payment information. At that time, a hold will be placed on the client’s credit card. Payment for the class or session will be processed upon completion of the class or session. You may cancel a class or session up to 24 hours prior to the scheduled class or session without charge or penalty; the hold on your card will simply be removed. Within 24 hours of the scheduled class or session, no cancellations are permitted, your credit card will be charged for the full amount due for the class or session, and no refunds will be provided. At Nutrifeedback’s sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by Nutrifeedback. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and the client shall be responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties associated with his or her purchases hereunder, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.</p>

    <p>Health coach</p>

    <p>When a client schedules a class or session with an health coach through the Site, the client will pay all amounts due at that time. Nutrifeedback may charge a fee to health coach (the “Administrative Fee”). Nutrifeedback will remit the amount of payment by the client, less the Administrative Fee to the health coach using the account information provided by the health coach. Clients may obtain a full refund for any class or session booked up to 24 hours prior to the scheduled class or session. Within 24 hours of the scheduled class or session, no refunds will be provided. At Nutrifeedback’s sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted to client’s in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by Nutrifeedback. Any refunds made to a client will be deducted from any amounts paid to the instructor. Any additional payment terms and details will be provided to health coaches by Nutrifeedback.</p>

   <p> 11. Links</p>

    <p>The Site and Services may contain links to other websites, or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third party’s website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any third-party website. You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website before using it.</p>

    <p>12. Changes to the Site or Services</p>

   <p> Nutrifeedback enhances and updates the Site and Services often. We may change or discontinue the Site or any Services, with or without notice to you.</p>

    <p>13. Termination</p>

   <p> We reserve the right not to provide the Site or Services to any user. We also reserve the right to terminate any user’s right to access the Site or Services at any time, in our discretion. If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Site and Services automatically terminates.</p>

    <p>14. Disclaimer and Limitations on Our Liability</p>

    <p>YOU USE THE SITE AND SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NUTRIFEEDBACK AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS (REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS “AFFILIATES”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE AND SERVICES (INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT).</p>

    <p>IN PARTICULAR, NUTRIFEEDBACK AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, any recommendations or other content available on or through the Site or Services), OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES LINKED TO THE SITE OR SERVICES. VINT AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY: (a) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (b) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES; (c) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION; (d) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES; (e) ANY COMPUTER VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CODE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES; OR (f) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY FUNCTIONALITY OR CONTENT POSTED, E-MAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>

    <p>NUTRIFEEDBACK AND ITS AFFILIATES DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY SERVICES OFFERED BY HEALTH COACHES, RECOMMENDED, ADVERTISED, OR OFFERED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE.</p>

    <p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS (INCLUDING BOTH CLIENTS AND HEALTH COACHES). YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NUTRIFEEDBACK MAY NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS OR SCREENINGS ON OR ANY OTHER SCREENING OF CLIENTS OR HEALTH COACHES. NUTRIFEEDBACK ALSO MAY NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ALL OF ALL CLIENTS OR HEALTH COACHES OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF CLIENTS OR HEALTH COACHES. NUTRIFEEDBACK MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF CLIENTS OR HEALTH COACHES OR THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE CLIENTS OR HEALTH COACHES. NUTRIFEEDBACK RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES), AT ANY TIME AND USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS.</p>

    <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIAL OR INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM DOING SO. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM VINT OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE IN THESE TERMS.</p>

    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER NUTRIFEEDBACK NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SITE OR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS.</p>

    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent Nutrifeedback may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Nutrifeedback’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.</p>

   <p> 15. Indemnification</p>

    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Nutrifeedback and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, and fees of any kind (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs), arising from or relating to: (a) any information (including your User Content or any other content) that you or anyone using your account submit, post, or transmit on or through the Site or Services; (b) the use of the Site or Services by you or anyone using your account; (c) the violation of these Terms by you or anyone using your account; or (d) the violation of any rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary rights by you or anyone using your account. Nutrifeedback reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. If we do assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with Nutrifeedback in such defense.</p>

    <p>16. Arbitration</p>

   <p> By accessing or using the Site or Services, you agree: (i) that any and all disputes you may have with, or claims you may have against Nutrifeedback or its Affiliates relating to, arising out of or connected in any way with (a) the Site or Services, (b) these Terms, or (c) the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a “Claim”), will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may be required by applicable law.</p>

    <p>If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Nutrifeedbackwill pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Nutrifeedback also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Nutrifeedback retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms of Use.
    </p>
   <p> 17. Other Provisions</p>

    <p>Under no circumstances will Nutrifeedback be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond its reasonable control.</p>

   <p> These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.</p>

    <p>You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms, the Site, or any Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York City County, New York. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.</p>

   <p> If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

    <p>The failure of Nutrifeedback to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent Nutrifeedback from enforcing such right or provision in the future.</p>

   <p> We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets, or by operation of law.</p>

    <p>18. Changes to these Terms</p>

    <p>We may change these Terms from time to time. If we change these Terms, we will inform you by posting the revised Terms on the Site. Those changes will go into effect on the “Revised” date shown in the revised Terms. By continuing to access or use the Site or Services, you agree to the revised Terms.</p>
